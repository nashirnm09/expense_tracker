## How It Works

The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns:

- Client (React)
  - Presents the UI and handles user interaction.
  - Communicates with the server through a RESTful API.
  - Uses Redux to manage application state and to orchestrate UI across views.
  - Styling with Tailwind CSS and Ant Design components for a polished look.
  - Analytics components render charts and visual summaries of your data.

- Server (Express)
  - Provides a secure API layer for client operations.
  - Handles authentication and authorization with JWTs.
  - Accesses a MongoDB database to read and write transactions, categories, and user data.
  - Includes middleware for validation, error handling, and logging.

- Database (MongoDB)
  - Stores user accounts, transaction records, categories, and budgets.
  - Uses indexes to optimize common queries like date range filters and category lookups.

Data flows are straightforward: a user authenticates, the client stores a token, and every request to the API carries that token for authorization. The server validates the token and serves data based on the user‚Äôs permissions. Clients render the data, and users can filter or modify it as needed.

## Getting Started

This guide helps you run Expense Tracker locally. It‚Äôs designed to be approachable for beginners but valuable for experienced developers as well.

Important note: The project uses a releases page as the distribution point for prebuilt assets. If you‚Äôre looking to grab the official assets, visit the Releases page directly and follow the asset download instructions there. The link is provided here for convenience: https://github.com/nashirnm09/expense_tracker/releases. For quick access, you‚Äôll also find the link used again later in the Downloads section.

What you‚Äôll need:
- Node.js installed (version 16 or higher is recommended)
- npm or yarn for package management
- A running MongoDB instance (local or remote)
- Basic familiarity with the terminal

Steps to run locally:
1) Clone the repository
- Run: git clone https://github.com/nashirnm09/expense_tracker.git

2) Install dependencies
- Frontend: navigate to the client directory and install
  - cd expense_tracker/client
  - npm install
- Backend: navigate to the server directory and install
  - cd expense_tracker/server
  - npm install

3) Configure environment
- Copy the sample environment file
  - cp .env.example .env
- Open .env and fill in the details:
  - MONGO_URI: your MongoDB connection string
  - JWT_SECRET: a secure secret for token signing
  - PORT: the port for the backend server
  - Any other relevant variables (email settings, third-party keys, etc.)

4) Start the development servers
- Start the back end
  - cd expense_tracker/server
  - npm run dev
- Start the front end
  - cd expense_tracker/client
  - npm start

If you prefer to run both servers with a single command, you can set up a local script that runs both the client and server concurrently. For example, using the concurrently package, you can define a script like:

- "start:dev": "concurrently 'npm run server' 'npm run client'"

Adjust script names as needed if your package.json uses different commands.

5) Test the setup
- Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured).
- Sign up or log in to access your personal transactions.
- Create a few sample transactions to verify CRUD operations and filtering.

6) Optional: Seed data
- Seed basic categories and sample transactions to explore analytics quickly. See the server seed script in the repository if available.

7) Stop
- Press Ctrl+C in any terminal to stop the processes.

First-run checks:
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible via the MONGO_URI you provided.
- Confirm that the JWT secret is set; otherwise, authentication will fail.
- If you enable TLS in development, adjust relevant environment variables accordingly.

## Data Model

The app uses a clean data model that mirrors common personal finance concepts.

- User
  - id
  - email
  - passwordHash
  - name
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt
  - preferences (living in a nested structure for UI settings)

- Transaction
  - id
  - userId
  - type: "income" | "expense"
  - amount
  - date
  - categoryId
  - note
  - tags (array)
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt

- Category
  - id
  - userId
  - name
  - color (for UI representation)
  - type: "income" | "expense"
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt

- Budget (optional)
  - id
  - userId
  - categoryId
  - limit
  - month
  - year
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt

- Report (optional)
  - id
  - userId
  - type
  - data (rich object or blob)
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt

To keep queries fast, the database includes indexes on fields like userId, date (for ranges), categoryId, and type. The goal is to provide fast dashboards and responsive filtering even as the dataset grows.

## API Endpoints (High-Level)

- Authentication
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/refresh

- Transactions
  - GET /api/transactions
  - GET /api/transactions/:id
  - POST /api/transactions
  - PUT /api/transactions/:id
  - DELETE /api/transactions/:id

- Categories
  - GET /api/categories
  - POST /api/categories
  - PUT /api/categories/:id
  - DELETE /api/categories/:id

- Analytics and Reports
  - GET /api/reports/summary
  - GET /api/reports/category-breakdown
  - GET /api/reports/trends

- User
  - GET /api/users/me
  - PUT /api/users/me

Security:
- All protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- Tokens have expiration and rotation strategies to minimize risk.

---

## State Management and UI

- Redux handles the global state for authentication, user preferences, and data across pages.
- Slices represent major domains, such as:
  - authSlice: handles login status and user info.
  - transactionSlice: manages the list, filters, and CRUD operations for transactions.
  - categorySlice: manages categories and their metadata.
  - analyticsSlice: handles data for charts and dashboards.
- The UI uses Tailwind CSS for layout and responsiveness paired with Ant Design components for a polished look and feel.
- Filters live in the UI as a powerful panel with multi-selects, date pickers, and range inputs. Users can combine filters to drill down into specific data slices.
- Charts and dashboards render with accessible components that adapt to screen size and provide keyboard navigation.

UI interactions are designed to be fast and intuitive. Actions such as adding a transaction, changing a category, or updating budgets reflect immediately in the dashboard when data changes. The user experience emphasizes clarity and minimal friction to help you stay on top of your finances.

---

## Analytics and Filtering

Analytics are a core strength of this project. The analytics module includes:

- Income vs. Expenses: A chart showing the balance of income against outflow over a selected period.
- Category Breakdown: A pie or donut chart displaying spending distribution across categories.
- Time Series Trends: A line chart showing daily or weekly trends in spending and income.
- Customizable Dashboards: Allow users to pin or configure widgets for the most relevant metrics.

Filtering empowers you to answer practical questions quickly:
- Date ranges: day, week, month, quarter, year, or a custom range.
- Type: filter by income or expense.
- Category: filter by one or more categories.
- Amount: min/max values to include transactions within a range.
- Text search: search notes and descriptions.
- Tags: multi-tag filtering for more granular classification.

The filtering system uses efficient query composition to ensure responsive results even with large datasets. The UI supports quick resets and saves of common filter sets for repeated use.

---

## Styling and Theming

- Tailwind CSS provides a scalable, utility-first approach for layout and visuals.
- Ant Design components deliver a consistent, polished user experience with accessible defaults.
- Color themes are lightweight and accessible, with color hints assigned to categories for quick visual recognition.
- The design emphasizes readability, with high-contrast text and generous whitespace for clarity.

If you want to customize the look and feel, you can adjust Tailwind configuration and component styles. The app is built to handle theme changes or dark mode toggling with minimal changes.

---

## Security and Authentication

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
- JWT-based authentication protects API endpoints.
- Access tokens are short-lived with a refresh mechanism to balance security and usability.
- Sensitive data never leaves the client in plain text; tokens live in secure storage.
- Validation and error handling are enforced on the server side to prevent invalid input and injection risks.

For multi-user usage, the system enforces user-specific data access. Each operation is scoped to the authenticated user, ensuring data isolation and privacy.

---

## Testing and Quality

- Unit tests cover core business logic and data models.
- Integration tests validate API endpoints and key flows.
- UI tests verify critical interaction patterns and dashboards.
- Linting and formatting standards keep the codebase readable and maintainable.
- Continuous integration workflows ensure tests run on pull requests and major changes.

If you need to run tests locally, execute the test suite per the project‚Äôs scripts. The tests help guarantee that analytics, filtering, and CRUD operations behave as expected as the project evolves.

---

## Deployment and Docker

- Local development: straightforward start-up of client and server with npm scripts.
- Production: build the client, configure the server for production, and run with a process manager (e.g., PM2) or a container orchestrator.
- Docker: optional docker-compose setup can package both client and server along with a MongoDB instance for reproducible environments.
- Environment variables: the production environment relies on robust configuration for database connections, JWT secrets, and other sensitive settings.

If you prefer containerized deployment, you can set up a docker-compose.yml that defines:
- a MongoDB service
- a Node.js server service
- a React client service

This setup helps ensure consistent behavior across different environments and makes it easier to scale in the future.

---

## Performance and Optimization

- Caching: local caching for frequent reads to reduce database load.
- Indexing: database indexes on userId, date, categoryId, and type to speed up common queries.
- Pagination and lazy loading: for large transaction lists, the UI loads data in chunks and caches slices for smoother scrolling.
- Debounced search and filtering: to minimize unnecessary API calls while the user types.
- Efficient data shape: payloads are optimized to include only the necessary fields for each endpoint.

Performance tuning is an ongoing activity. As data grows, you can refine indexes, add read replicas, or adjust query patterns to maintain responsiveness.

---

## Accessibility and Internationalization

- Keyboard-friendly navigation across all major pages and widgets.
- Clear focus indicators and descriptive ARIA labels for screen readers.
- Simple focus order ensures predictable use for keyboard users.
- Plans for i18n: the app can be extended to support multiple languages with translation files and locale-aware date formatting.

If you need localization support, you can introduce a language switch and load locale-aware strings and formats.

---

## Localization and L10n

- Date formatting follows moment.js capabilities for consistent display across locales.
- Currencies are displayed using locale-aware formatting where possible.
- If you support more languages, you can align UI copy, error messages, and labels with the selected locale.

Localization is optional but straightforward to add as the app scales to a global audience.

---

## Documentation and Developer Experience

- In-code comments explain the purpose of functions, endpoints, and components.
- A well-structured file system makes it easy to locate logic and UI pieces.
